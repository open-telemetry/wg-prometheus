# OpenTelemetry Prometheus Working Group

This repository is used to track the progress of the Prometheus
workgroup to address compatibility gaps between OpenTelemetry
and Prometheus, and improve the OpenTelemetry Prometheus
support.

The working group follows a phased approach:

* [Phase 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPSNg3H3HkHTmx9cWO25nJ9NIf2CCcl4Qg6LqFCF8RY/edit#heading=h.mw5znsnvycii)
* [Phase 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPSNg3H3HkHTmx9cWO25nJ9NIf2CCcl4Qg6LqFCF8RY/edit#heading=h.bq3rimntyq3s)

The progress of the group can be tracked
